WIP: add the different types of steps. -->

<h3 id="registration-process">Registration Process</h3>

<p>The registration process allows to create the different paths that can be followed by the attendee during his registration. From here you organise the steps. One step can be used more than once.</p>

<p>It all starts from the root, a step that the attendee will not see. You can only add a new step from that point. Then…</p>

<p>Delete: delete that point in the path. All the next points are still preserved and just get closer to the root.</p>

<p>Add step: add a step just after the current step.</p>

<p>Branch: add a step to the right (on the same level).</p>

<p>(Un)mark as step: this step will appear in the breadcrumb.</p>

<p>The ↓ and ↕ buttons indicates if the attendee is, respectively, not allowed to go back or is allowed to go back and forth of the next step. Clicking on it will reverse the rights.</p>

<h2 id="groups-rights">Groups rights</h2>

<p>Users can be assigned to different groups with specific rights on the registration system.</p>

<p>The rights can be found on Attendees &gt; Groups.</p>

<!-- ### Edit a group

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Waiting for Preview</em>: the news is not displayed on the website, and is waiting to be proofread.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Published</em>: the news is displayed on the website.</p>

<h2 id="mass-emails">Mass Emails</h2>

<p>It is possible to schedule emails sendings. The system uses conditions and the groups to limit which users should get the mails</p>

<p><strong>Warning: do not use it for advertising, unless the users have given their consent (RGPD).</strong></p>

<h3 id="sending-an-email">Sending an email</h3>

<p>To schedule a mail for mass sending, you will have to go to News &gt; Mass Emailing.</p>

<p>From there a wizard will guide you step by step to schedule the mail.</p>

<p>If no group is selected, then everyone will receive the mail.</p>

<p>It is the same for the conditions, if none is chosen, there will be no filter from there.</p>

<p>As for the documents, you can use html, tags and markdown.</p>

<p>Note: the schedule date is in the following format YYYY-MM-DD (with YYYY being the year, MM the month and DD the days all in numerical form).</p>

<h3 id="email-sending-conditions">Email sending conditions</h3>

<p>Conditions configuration can be created and saved to be used and reused for each time mails have to be sent. It can be accessed from News &gt; Conditions, and can be created from News &gt; New conditions</p>

<p>The conditions can use the profile data, tickets and forms in order to decide whether or not to send an email to a specific user.</p>

<h3 id="email-models">Email models</h3>

<p>Email Models are templates for the emails, they can be used as a way to emphasize the content or just make it look nicer.</p>

<p>Existing models are available through News &gt; Models, and can be created from News &gt; New model.</p>

<p>As for the documents, you can use html, tags and markdown.</p>

<h3 id="scheduled-mails">Scheduled mails</h3>

<p>It is possible to see the scheduled mails, and to cancel them or reset them. Go to News &gt; Scheduled mails.</p>

<p>The page provide an overview of the sending date, the conditions used, the groups to which to mail it, the model used and the state.</p>

<p>The different possible states are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Idle: the mail sending has been scheduled, and will be sent on the requested day when * the mail sending job will be running (normally around 3:00 in the morning).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cancelled: the mail sending has been cancelled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Done: the mails have successfully been sent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Error: an error happened while sending the mails.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Deleting will end up in definitely removing the mail from the schedule.</p>

<p>Clicking on the mail name will give you more information about that scheduled mail: a preview, sending date, conditions… and the users to which the emails have been sent.</p>

<p>This will help you to diagnose if the conditions were working correctly.</p>

<h2 id="system">System</h2>

<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

<p>Platy+ can be updated from System &gt; Update. For the moment the files have to be updated manually.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance-modes">Maintenance modes</h3>

<p>The system can display a maintenance page separately for the website part, the registration part or for both. This can be accessed from System &gt; Maintenance.</p>

<p>In the screenshot, all the maintenance modes are deactivated.</p>

<h3 id="version">Version</h3>

<p>The page provides miscellaneous information about the registration system (version, changelog, licenses…).</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>It is possible to provide translations for dynamic fields. Normally, the translations it is already accessible from the edition interfaces of the events, products, etc. But it is possible to find all the translations through System &gt; Localize.</p>

<h1 id="attendees-interface">Attendee’s interface</h1>

<p>The administrators and registration staff should get used to the attendee’s interface in order to provide them quick assistance.</p>

<p>Here are the different functionalities the user has access to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Custom forms from the profile.</p>
  </li>

<h1 id="how-to">How to</h1>

<p>This part contains quick tutorials on more or less advanced uses of certain functionalities.</p>

<!-- WIP -->

<h2 id="attendees-1">Attendees</h2>

<h3 id="cancel-an-invoice">Cancel an invoice</h3>

<p>For legal reasons you can’t delete an already generated invoice, you will have then to create a negative invoice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you know the Order number or the Invoice number:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Directly go to Orders &gt; Orders and from there click on the invoice you want to cancel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t know the number, but you know the user’s regnumber. You can access to it from the user’s edition page.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Go to Attendees &gt; Attendees list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Find the user and edit it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Go on the Orders tab</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are on the order you want to cancel, you can just hit the “remove” button for each line of the invoice (if you want to partially cancel an invoice, you hust have to hit the “remove” button for the specific lines you want to cancel).</p>

<p>It will look like you are creating a new quote.</p>

<p>Once you are done removing the products, hit the “Save and create a new quote” button on the top left of the page.</p>

<p>From here you have quote cancelling the invoice. As it is a quote, you can still edit it (add/remove products).</p>

<p>Once you have obtained what you wanted, you can hit the “Generate Invoice” button.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to remove manually the bookings and tickets that you cancelled.</p>

<p>Go back to the user’s edition page (you can click on his regnumber).</p>

<p>Then go to the Ticket &amp; Bookings tab.</p>

<p>For the payments and reimbursements, check with your head of registration on how to proceed.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-user">Create a user</h3>

<p>For on site registration, guests or for users having trouble you can directly create a new user.</p>

<p>Go to Attendees &gt; Add a User.</p>

<h3 id="generate-a-quote">Generate a quote</h3>

<p>For products that are not accessible through the registration steps or for users who have troubles you can manually generate a quote.</p>

<p>The user will see the quote from his Profile panel. Once he initiates payment, it is turned into an invoice.</p>

<p>Check on the user’s profile in the “Bookings and tickets” tab if everything has been set correctly.</p>

<h3 id="manually-create-an-invoice">Manually create an invoice</h3>

<p>See first “Generate a quote”.</p>

<p>Once a quote is created, you can generate an invoice.</p>

<h3 id="delete-a-user">Delete a user</h3>

<p>While it is very straightforward, some points should be carefully be taken into account.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Has the user an unpaid invoice?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maybe cancel the invoices, and check that the user payment balance is what it is expected to be.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the user still bookings/goodies/etc?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You should remove any items that the user is never going to claim before deleting the user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Also if a badge has been sent for printing don’t forget to remove it from the batch.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The steps are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Go to Attendees &gt; Attendees list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for the user for which you want to delete the account. And edit that user</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all the verifications have been done go to the Delete Tab. Check “Delete the user” and hit “Delete”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What data is there left?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user’s invoices and quotes are kept for legal reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>There should be a desk put apart for people who didn’t bought the badge or in case of issues with the registration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A computer with internet connection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A badge printer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A regular printer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An electronic payment point/cash box.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Registered attendees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Attendees should move into a unique flow:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Liability waiver: the attendee should sign it first.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ID check and badge distribution: check the ID card (name and birthday).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Convention package.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>T-shirt</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Room key (if relevant).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Non registered attendees</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They can go directly to the non-registered desk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a ticket there, sign the liability waiver and get a badge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once registered, they can get back into the registered attendees line.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="closing-of-the-registration">Closing of the registration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be careful that everything is packed and ordered correctly. Download a local copy of the attendees and/or make an offline backup of the attendees list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check there are enough liability waivers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the room can be closed by a key, leave the computers and the stuff in the room. Close correctly the room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Count the money, write and date the last count. Bring the money to the accountant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reopening">Reopening</h3>

<p>1 hour before:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check if there are new badges to print.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print the badges, prepare the packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do as during the opening.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="troubleshooting-1">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>While Platy+ is getting used by more and more events, some bugs can happen and quick and proper answers should be brought to that situations to avoid data loss and attendees from waiting for too long.</p>

<p>But the greatest risks are external issues (no Internet connection, server not reachable, etc). You will also find here answers to that situation.</p>
