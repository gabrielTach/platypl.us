<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>
	It allows your attendees to register, and it processes the payments. You can choose which payments method to use (actually Ingenico-ogone, Stripe and bank transfers for now). It is relatively easy for us to expand it to other payment methods (PayPal for example).
</p>
<p>
	It is relatively flexible. You can edit the registration steps, which tickets and options your attendees can buy. Plus an attendee can buy more than one ticket and then attribute them to his friends or automatically book for a room.
</p>

<h2>Why not using it?</h2>
<p>
	Platy+ is a registration system that has already been used in for other cons/events. You don't have to develop again functionalities that already exist somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
	We are planning on making our system more and more robust. And you benefit from our experience, as we are directly using and testing it in real life conditions.
</p>
<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>
	We are currently working on making Platy+ Open Source and easy to install. For more information contact the lead developer  <a href="https://twitter.com/JanTaverniers" title="Contact">@janTaverniers on Twitter</a>.
